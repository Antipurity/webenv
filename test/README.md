You fool.

You thought that this is the directory for the processes that make sure that every component of WebEnv works.

But WebEnv is too modular, and each module changes very rarely and can just be held in mind when it does (only requiring a few sanity checks at the end to make sure it works), so why should automated testing exist for it?

This is just the test web page to test that plain-web-page `webenv.remote` connections work.
