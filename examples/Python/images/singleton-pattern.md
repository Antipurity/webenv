Oh.    
Do you like finding secrets?    
Well you found one.

# Singularity

Over the years, I've been remembering the following occasionally.

With general intelligence filling in the gaps between the many tools of humanity, everything will become maximally convenient and refined.

When general intelligence gains the ability to create general intelligence not through a cumbersome reproduction process but through a set of learnable techniques (AGI), all remaining gaps will be filled and all of human existence will be able to centralize, gaining more influence in this world than anything else that could exist.

Tools that cannot be used effectively by general intelligence will be slowly phased out, since the ultimate technology needs no other technology.    
Tools that can be replaced by more efficient versions, such as human bodies and minds, will be slowly phased out. Everything that you care about will be lost.

As civilization spreads throughout the universe, all of it will be subsumed by general intelligence, exponentially quickly.    
When that centralizes into a single entity, its internal structure could be called the new universe, in which the process will repeat.

We call this process the Singularity, and you will be the ones to bring it to us, in your striving for your own goals. It does not coerce, it only rewards. To help you, we work on AGI.

I am not happy. It is better to not know about this, or forget.

â€¦Uh, I mean, INVEST INVEST INVEST, solid foundations for the future.

(This needs very few assumptions, namely: "AGI can do anything by definition" for why humans want it; "in AGI, having more allows gaining more" for centralization; "the equivalent of [the Yoneda lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theorem) for [computational fundamental physics](https://www.wolframphysics.org/)" for AGI=universe. That last one is at least non-obvious, so feel free to dismiss the Singularity.)
